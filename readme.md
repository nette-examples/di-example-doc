Example of using Nette DI Container
===================================

Purpose of the Dependecy Injection (DI) is to free classes from the responsibility for obtaining objects that they need for its operation (these objects are called **services**). Documentation can be found on the [website](https://doc.nette.org/dependency-injection).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nette-examples/di-example-doc
cd di-example-doc
composer install
```

```shell
php example.php
```

It requires PHP version 8.0 and supports PHP up to 8.1.
